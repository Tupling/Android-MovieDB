Movie Database Android Application
=============

The overall intention of this application is to demonstrate the use of ContentResolver and Fragmentations.


This application uses TheMovieDB API, in which allows the user to search for a particular term in a movie title. The user will be presented with a list of movies that contain the keyword in which they wish to search.  After the user is presented with a list of movies they are then able to filter the list by year in which they believe their desired movie was produced.  Once the user has found the movie they were searching for they can select the movie and are then presented with a view that has additional details about the movie.
